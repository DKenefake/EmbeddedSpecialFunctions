# EmbeddedSpecialFunctions
A special functions library meant for use in microcontrollers/embedded systems. A focus of this library is to provide reference implementations of different accuracies. Here we will be using optimal polynomial approximation and be looking at optimal rational polynomial approximations of these functions. 

The short term goals are to implement the special function of ```math.h``` and then perhaps look at additional functions.
